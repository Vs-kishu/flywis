        Iâ€™m a teenager who developed stretch marks through puberty. I really
        hated the way it looked. The stretch marks appeared on my thighs, knees,
        and buttocks area. I went to see Shahina for a consultation and she
        recommended micro-needling treatment. I completed 3 sessions. I am very
        pleased with the results.
